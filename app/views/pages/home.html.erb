                    <p >The world is an ever changing place. And as we all know, the present time faces terrific challenges that must be dealt with, or else the consequences can be, and I beleive will be, catastrophic.  Which is why I have set out to write and educate not only myself, but hopefuly others about the state of our world and the actions wee could take.</p>
                    <p>With that being said, I also beleive the studying the history could lead us in the right direction and teach us something about ourselves today.  For many deacdes, I have been fascinated with the study of ancient Egypt. In particular the reign of Cleopatra and her escapades, intelligence, and explorations throught out her world.</p>
